# Proposal
### Project Overview

The goal of our application is to create a better networking experience for meet-up attendees. Many developers attend meet-ups
to make connections with exciting people in their field, and potential future employers. We want to effectively increase the productivity
of this meet-up experience by providing attendees with up to date details on who will be attending, as well as what that person does.
Armed with this information users will find it easier to hone in on those individuals who are best suited to their interests!``
